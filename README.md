# MacOS Config

This repository is used to simplify the process of setting up a new Mac.
It includes a list of software, configurations, and tools that I use on a daily basis.
It's based on homebrew to keep everything up to date and the applications in sync across multiple machines.

Have a look into the [Makefile](Makefile) to see all available commands.

The repository also contains configuration files for the following tools:

- Karabiner-Elements
- rectangle
- iterm2
- sol

## Requirements

Make sure `git` is installed on your machine.
Just run `git` one time in your terminal and follow the instructions to install it.
